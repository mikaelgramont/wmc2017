<p>There will be space on site for camping and we even have tents for people flying in (please ask ahead of time, at least one week before the event). We&#8217;ll have showers available 5 minutes away in a building with restrained access, as well as bathrooms on site.</p>
<p>There will not be any food on location outside of the meals that come with registration, so please plan accordingly. The closest supermarket is a short 10-minute drive away (see map).</p>
