The AMC, Compiègne’s mountainboarding club and the International Mountainboarding Association are proud to present the 2017 Mountainboard World Championships!
</p>
<p>
The competition will be held in Venette, France (near Compiègne, in the Oise region) from July 13th to the 15th, and for the first time, we’ll have both Boardercross and Freestyle at the same time!
</p>
<p>
We’ll have 4 categories: Junior, Ladies, Masters and Open.
</p>

This year’s event promises to be exciting: for Boardercross, will someone steal the podium from Matt Brind who won the last 3 editions? As for Freestyle, well there hasn’t been a World Freestyle Championship in several years, so riders from all over the world will be eager to show their skills and new tricks.
